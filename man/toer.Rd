\arguments{
\item{design}{An object of class \code{Basket} created by
\code{setupBasket}.}

\item{n}{The sample size per basket.}

\item{lambda}{The posterior probability threshold. See details for more
information.}

\item{epsilon}{A tuning parameter that determines the amount of borrowing.
See details for more information.}

\item{tau}{A tuning parameter that determines how similar the baskets
have to be that borrowing occurs. See details for more information.}

\item{logbase}{A tuning parameter that determines which logarithm base is
used to compute the Jensen-Shannon divergence. See details for more
information.}

\item{prune}{Whether the results should be pruned before the final
analysis. See details for more information.}

\item{results}{Whether only the family wise error rate (option \code{fwer})
or also the rejection probabilities per group (option \code{group}) should
be returned.}

\item{...}{Further arguments.}
}
\value{
If \code{results = "fwer"} then the family wise type 1 error rate is
returned as a numeric value. If \code{results = "group"} then a list with
the rejection probabilities per group and the family wise type 1 error rate
is returned. If all theta1 > theta0 then the family wise type 1 error rate
is calculated under the global null hypothesis. For baskets with theta1 =
theta0 the rejection probabilities corresponds to the type 1 error rate, for
baskets with theta1 > theta0 the rejection probabilities corresponds to the
power.
}
\description{
Computes the exact family wise type 1 error rate of a basket trial .
}
\details{
\code{toer} computes the exact family wise type 1 error rate and the
exact rejection probabilities per group. The family wise type 1 error rate
is the probability to reject at least one null hypothesis for a basket with
theta1 = theta0. If all theta1 > theta0 then the family wise type 1 error
rate under the global null hypothesis is computed. The rejection
probabilities correspond to the type 1 error rate for baskets with theta1 =
theta 0 and to the power for baskets with theta1 > theta 0.

If \code{prune = TRUE} then the baskets with an observed number of baskets
smaller than the pooled critical value are not borrowed from. The
pooled critical value is the smallest integer c for which all null
hypotheses can be rejected if the number of responses is exactly c for
all baskets.

This method is implemented for the class \code{\link{OneStageBasket}}.
