\description{
Weights Based on Fujikawa et al.'s Design
}
\details{
\code{weights_fujikawa} calculates the weights used for sharing
information between baskets based on the proposal by Fujikawa et al. (2020).
The weight for two baskets i and j is found as
\eqn{(1 - JSD(i, j))^\varepsilon} where \eqn{JSD(i, j)} is the Jensen-Shannon
divergence between the individual posterior distributions of the response
probabilities of basket i and j. Note that Fujikawa's weights also share the
prior information between the baskets.

A small value of epsilon results in stronger borrowing also across baskets
with heterogenous results. If epsilon is large then information is only
borrowed between baskets with similar results. If a weight is smaller than
tau it is set to 0, which results in no borrowing.

If \code{prune = TRUE} then the baskets with an observed number of baskets
smaller than the pooled critical value are not borrowed from. The
pooled critical value is the smallest integer c for which all null
hypotheses can be rejected if the number of responses is exactly c for
all baskets.

The function is generally not called by the user but passed to another
function such as \code{\link{toer}} and \code{\link{pow}} to specify
how the weights are calculated.
